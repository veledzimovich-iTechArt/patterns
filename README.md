Design patterns

- Separate permanent and incapsulate flexible data/algorithms
- Programm on the interface (abstract) level not realization
- Composition better than inheritance
- Weak references
- Open/closed
- Dependency inversion - code depends from abstractions NOT from realization
- Principle of Least Knowledge - (loose coupling, minimum awareness) connect only with close friends
- Hollywood principe (Don not call us. We call you) high level component define behaviour of low level components.
- Single responsibility principe (cohension) - one cause to change
