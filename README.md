# Design patterns

## Principles

- Separate permanent and incapsulate flexible data/algorithms
- Programm on the interface (abstract) level not realization
- Composition better than inheritance
- Weak references
- Open/closed
- Dependency inversion - code depends from abstractions NOT from realization
- Principle of Least Knowledge - connect only with close friends
- Hollywood principe - high level component define behaviour of low level components.
- Single responsibility principe - one cause to change

## Pattern
Pattern is a solving task in context

- context - typical situation to use pattern
- task - our goal depends of context restrictions
- solving - code structure to reach goals with restrictions

Patterns balance of "powers"
- goal (light side)
- restrictions (dark side)
